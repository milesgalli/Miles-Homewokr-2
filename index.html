        <!--About Me Description -->
      <p class="card-text" >
            Originally born in Zimbabwe, lived in Botswana and relocated to Australia with my family in 2004. From a young age, I was able to understand how fortunate I am to live in a country like Australia. This motivated me to make the most of every opportunity that came my way. Being an immigrant in Australia, sport become a way for me to assimilate into Australian culture.
           <br> 
          <br>
            Playing team sports such as rugby and cricket formed the basis of my understandings of team work and allowed me to experience leadership, which I thrived on.
        <br>
          <br>
            My passion for business began at an early age whilst experiencing shopping in the major food chain supermarkets. Later, I began reading books relating to business and self made success stories. This interest drove me to begin my studies in the field of Marketing and Management. As I progressed further in my readings about Silicon Valley. My interest for technology began to grow, immersing myself with podcasts, books and latest reports.
           <br>
          <br>
            I am a lover of the outdoors in general, devoting my time to surfing, free diving and fishing in the ocean. I love to travel with my friends. Some of my favourite places to travel include, Indonesia, Spain, Thailand, Greece and Croatia.
